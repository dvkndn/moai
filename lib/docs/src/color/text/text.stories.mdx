# Text Color

The `text` utility contains classes that set [text color][1]. These colors are
dynamic: they are automatically changed based on the current theme. 
clear and accessible in both light and dark themes.

```ts
import { text } from "@moai/core";

<span className={text.muted}>Text</span>
```

### Gray colors

There are 2 gray text colors. They can be used for both texts and icons due to
their high contrast ratio.

<ColorText
	rows={[
		{ key: "normal", usage: "both" },
		{ key: "muted", usage: "both" },
	]}
/>

The `normal` value sets the color back to the default text color, e.g. a
near-black in light theme. Since it's the app's default, you usually don't need
to use this class, except to override an inherited color from a parent.

The `muted` value dims the color. It is usually used for secondary texts, like
labels and descriptive texts. Their contrast ratios are always above 4.5 to
[ensure legibility][3] in both light and dark themes.

### Semantic colors

There are 3 semantic colors in the `text` object. Each has a `Strong` version
for text (contrast 4.5+) and a `Weak` version for icon (contrast 3+):

<ColorText
	rows={[
		{ key: "highlightStrong", usage: "text" },
		{ key: "highlightWeak", usage: "icon" },
		{ key: "successStrong", usage: "text" },
		{ key: "successWeak", usage: "icon" },
		{ key: "failureStrong", usage: "text" },
		{ key: "failureWeak", usage: "icon" },
	]}
/>

Note that colors should never be used alone for communication. When using a
semantic color, always ensure users can still understand the context [without
it][4], via helper texts or icons.

For example, communicate the status by using different color for the same icon
is bad because users with [color blindness][1] won't be able to differentiate
them.
