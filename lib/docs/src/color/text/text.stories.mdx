# Text Color

The `text` utility contains classes that set the [CSS `color`][1] property.
This is the recommended way to set color for texts and icons since they are
automatically changed based on the current theme and always conform to the
[WCAG of contrast ratios][3] at AA level.

```ts
import { text } from "@moai/core";

<span className={text.muted}>Text</span>
```

## Gray colors

There are 2 gray colors in the `text` utility. They can be used for both texts
and icons due to their high contrast ratios:

<ColorText
	rows={[
		{ key: "normal", usage: "both" },
		{ key: "muted", usage: "both" },
	]}
/>

The `normal` value sets the color back to the default text color, e.g. a
near-black in light theme. Since it's the app's default, you usually don't need
to use this class, except to override an inherited color from a parent.

The `muted` value dims the color. It is usually used for secondary texts, like
labels and descriptive texts. Their contrast ratios are always above 4.5 to
[ensure legibility][3] in both light and dark themes.

## Semantic colors

There are 3 semantic colors in the `text` utility. Each has a `Strong` version
for texts (contrast 4.5+) and a `Weak` version for icons (contrast 3+):

<ColorText
	rows={[
		{ key: "highlightStrong", usage: "text" },
		{ key: "highlightWeak", usage: "icon" },
		{ key: "successStrong", usage: "text" },
		{ key: "successWeak", usage: "icon" },
		{ key: "failureStrong", usage: "text" },
		{ key: "failureWeak", usage: "icon" },
	]}
/>

Note that colors should never be used alone for communication. When using a
semantic color to represent an intention, always ensure users can still get it
without the color, using other elements like a helper text or icon.

For example, communicating the status of an element by using different color on
the same icon is not accessible because users with [color blindness][1] won't
be able to differentiate them.
