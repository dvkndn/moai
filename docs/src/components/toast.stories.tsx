The \`toast\` function let you create a toast imperatively. You can call it
from anywhere in your app. The created toast will be rendered on top of your
app, and go away after a few seconds. The \`toast\` function expects 2
parameters:

- The type of the toast, which controls the icon and color of the toast. It
should come from \`toast.types\`.
- The message inside the toast.

This makes it easy to show a toast after an event, like a successful \`fetch\`
call. You don't need to maintain any state or render any thing for the toast.

The Toast Pane component let you have a toast rendered in-place, declaratively.
This is useful when you want a permanent toast somewhere in your app. A common
usage is to render a toast conditionally based on a state and optionally reset
that state via the \`close\` prop to let users close it.

Similar to the \`toast\` function, Toast Pane requires its type to be defined
via the \`type\` prop and its message via the \`children\` prop. If the
\`close\` callback is defined, the toast will also have a close button which
triggers that callback.
